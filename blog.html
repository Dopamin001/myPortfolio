				<h2>Roadtrip Albania 2021</h2>
				<div class="maintext">
					
					<p>In beginning of May 2021, my Girlfriend an me had 3 Weeks of Holiday but Germany was still in Lockdown. <br>
					So after a bit of researching we figure out, that Albania was more or less free of restrictions. So we booked a flight.<br>
					From Frankfurt to Tirana (the only International Airport of Albania) it took us 2 hours, and finally we arrived there and 11pm. <br>
					We crossed the Passport control without any Problems, walked for 3 Minutes down the street and made the check-in at <br>
					our Hotel. The Room was clean and looked new. For 35€ for both it was pretty fine. <br> <br>
					Next day we rent a Scoda Fabia (25€/day incl. full insurance) and started our Roadtrip. <br>
					If you also think about to rent a Car in Albania i would recommand to book it online before. <br> The local car renters have strange
					insurance conditions. <br>

					So we coverd the next few days the Coast of Albania. Its mostly Stone Strand, but Ocean is really beautiful and you can do a swim. <br>
					Guesthouses are cheep. We payed ~20€ for room inkl. Breakfast directly over the Ocean. And 70€ for a 4* Hotel. <br>
					BUT the Negative Site was all the garbage on the trails, roads, beaches and in the Ocean. Garbage in Albania is everywhere. <br>
					Also there a Tons auf Constructions Sites, special close to the Beaches, which made a lot of Noise sometimes. <br>
					A lot of them seems to become very luxery, so i think the prices will increase a lot the next few years in Albania. <br>
					So better go now!

						Also we made a Daytrip to the famous "Blue Eye". It's the most water rich source of the Country, and the water colors are really amazing.<br> 
						So it's Definitely worth to check it out.

						After the first week we made a trip vom the South to the North of Albania to discover the Alps. It took us over 10 hours for ~ 500km. <br>
						Overall i would say, the Streets in Albania are better then their call. Also the trip was quit interesting to the so much of the country in one day. <br>
						From Nature Point, Albania seems to be very amazing. We saw lot of pure wilderness(forests, lakes, rivers, Mountains) while we drove. <br>
						But for locals it seems to be very tough to live there, cause there is so much less infrastructure than in Germany.

						So our last week we spended in the Mountains, with a couple of Hikes. But sadly there was still a lot of snow so the most hikes were not possible.
						But it was still really amazing. Food was really nice, Our Host and the locals were always friendly, and the view on the nightsky was just incredible.
						I would recommand to go the the Albania Alps end of of September/ beginning of october. Less Hot, Less Tourists, no Snow.
